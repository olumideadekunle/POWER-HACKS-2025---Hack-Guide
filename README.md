________________________________________
1. Introduction
Power Hacks 2025 is a Pan-African call to action inviting young innovators to build digital tools that make online spaces safer for everyone, while addressing the unique challenges faced by women and girls.
Held in honor of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, this hackathon brings together developers, designers, creators, and activists to build bold, impactful solutions centered on safety, dignity, and empowerment.
Safety is not a slogan.
It’s something we build — together — with courage and code.
Let’s hack for safety. Let’s hack for justice. Let’s hack for all.
